Hello everyone!
My name is Danial and I really love programming. 
I'm currently learning front-end development and it's sooo exciting!
I began learning it not long ago, therefore I don't have a lot of experience.
Now I spend most of my after school time learning front-end.
Currently I don't have any options for you to reach me, because I don't really use social networks (They take away so much time!).
